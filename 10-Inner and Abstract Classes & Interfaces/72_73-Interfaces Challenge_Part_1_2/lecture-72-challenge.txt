        // Create a simple interface that allows an object to be saved to some sort of storage medium.
        // The exact type of medium is not known to the interface (nor to the classes that implement it).
        // The interface will just specify 2 methods, one to return an ArrayList of values to be saved
        // and the other to populate the object's fields from an ArrayList.
        //
        // Create some sample classes that implement your saveable interface (we've used the idea of a game,
        // with Players and Monsters, but you can create any type of classes that you want).
        //
        // Override the toString() method for each of your classes so that they can be easily printed to enable
        // the program to be tested easier.
        //
        // In Main, write a method that takes an object that implements the interface as a parameter and
        // "saves" the values.
        // We haven't covered I/O yet, so your method should just print the values to the screen.
        // Also in Main, write a method that restores the values to a saveable object.
        // Again, we are not going to use Java file I/O; instead use the readValues() method below to
        // simulate getting values from a file – this allows you to type as many values as your class
        // requires, and returns an ArrayList.
